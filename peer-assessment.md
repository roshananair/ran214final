### Automate


- [X] **The entire analysis is automated**
  - Data reading and cleaning is handled in a standalone script that creates intermediate output(s).
  - The analysis is performed in a Quarto document that reads intermediate outputs.
  - Files in the R/ folder exclusively define functions and have no other side effects.
  - All scripts run without errors.


The code runs without error. You only have to clean up the paper.qmd since you have 1_clean_data.R script already as well as the moving-average3.R script


- [X] **The analysis produces the expected output**
  - The Quarto document performs the data analysis (moving average).
  - The Quarto document creates a figure that is a reasonable approximation of the original.


The figure output is within a reasonable approximation of the original. Good job!


### Organize


- [X] **Data are properly organized**
  - _Raw_ data is contained in its own folder.
  - _Outputs_ are contained in a separate folder from raw data.


Yes the raw data and output data are within separate folders.  


- [X] **Code is properly organized**
  - At least one function is defined in a script in R/ and used elsewhere in the workflow.
  - All code in the repo (_except_ in the scratch/ folder) is required for the analysis (i.e., no "safety blanket" code remaining)


The workflow of the code is good and contains at least one function.


### Document


- [] **The repo has an effective README**
  - A short, but descriptive title
    - A README’s title is set to the repository name by default - change this!
  - A brief explanation of the repository’s purpose
    - Paragraphs or a bulleted list are both acceptable options
    - You may include an image or logo that represents the project
  - A concise description of what’s housed in the repository
    - This includes information about the repository structure or file organization
  - Details regarding data access
    - Any necessary information on where data lives (e.g. is it housed in the repo, on a server, in a library/package etc.) and how to access it in order to run the code
  - A list of authors or current contributors (for collaborative work)
    - Consider hyperlinking collaborators’ GitHub profiles or other professional profile
  - References
    - In an appropriate, consistent format, including links.
    - Don’t forget to add references for datasets too.
   
The overall README looks good. You could potentially add more background information to your repo and finish the other sections such as Scripts.


- [X] **Code follows a professional style**
  - All code files follow a consistent style (the Air formatter automates this).
  - The code has an appropriate amount of comments.
    - Comments are minimized by using _meaningful variable names_ and _helper functions_.
    - Comments are used to [explain the _why_ of code, not the _what_](https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html#comments).


The variable names are meaningful and the code follows a consistent style. Don't forget to add some comments that explain the function of the code.
